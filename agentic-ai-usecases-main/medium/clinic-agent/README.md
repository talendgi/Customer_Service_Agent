```

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
   # The .env file should contain: OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## How It Works

### Conversation Flow

1. **Greeting** → Bot welcomes user and shows specialities
2. **Select Speciality** → User picks a medical speciality
3. **Select Doctor** → Bot shows doctor info and available slots
4. **Select Time Slot** → User picks a time
5. **Confirm** → Review and confirm appointment
6. **Completed** → Booking confirmation with ID

### LLM-Based Routing

The agent uses OpenAI's GPT model for:
- **Intent classification** - Understanding what the user wants
- **Entity extraction** - Extracting specialities and time slots
- **State transitions** - Deciding next stage based on context

No regex or hard-coded rules - everything is handled by the LLM!

### Database Schema

**doctors** table:
- doctor_id, doctor_name, speciality, office_timing

**customers** table:
- customer_id, name, phone,email

**bookings** table:
- booking_id, doctor_id, customer_id, appointment_date, appointment_time, status
